# Dynamic Data Visualization (DDVIZ) Workshop (June, 2021)

As the clinical and neuroscientific questions and datasets we regularly interact with become larger and more complex, there is a growing need for tools that can help us to gain useful insights into the underlying trends and patterns.  This [NIMH](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/)-led workshop focused on one such class of tools: dynamic data visualizations.  Speakers discussed and provided hands-on experience with cutting-edge approaches to using dynamic visualizations to gain insights into data.
